# My Resume
This project is using React Native, Expo and Expo Go to create a first mobile application based on the following requirements:

1. **User Requirements** - Text messages in a yellow background color. The text messages show: name, degree program, and school and department.
2. **System Requirements** - You can use a total of five React Native components (1 View, 3 Text, and StyleSheet).

## input-process-output model:
1. A requirement from the environment (input)
2. A computation based on the requirement (process)
3. A provision for the environment (output)

### 1. Input
Runs the app in the development mode after creating a Mobile app

Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in your browser.

### 2. Process
1. Create a Github repo
2. Select the _"code"_ button from the tab and from the dropdown menu select Codespaces to create codespace on main.
3. Connect your Expo credentials run:
```
npx expo login
```

Note: enter your username and password

4. In the terminal run to create the mobile app:
```
npx create-expo-app replaceWithMobileAppName
```
5. CD into the newly created MobileAppName directory from the terminal
6. Add your code. Once satisfied. To start up your app, run:
```
npm run web
```
OR
```
npx expo start --tunnel
```

Note: Uses a **_tunnel_** connection (via Expo servers), allowing your mobile device to connect even if itâ€™s on a different Wi-Fi or cellular network.

If it asks to install @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0, type **_"y"_** for yes.

6. Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in your browser, scan the QR code or manually type the https://evbjwaw-zandra2-8081.exp.direct/ url onto your mobile device.

Note: To view the mobile app on your device you need to install **_Expo Go_** onto your phone first to be able to use the following feature. 

-To view the app on the browser type **_"w"_** on your terminal. -To view the app on a mobile device scan the QR code or manually type the given exp link.

7. To exit the application run,
```
control + c
```

# Additional Information: Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
