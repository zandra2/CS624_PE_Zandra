# PE06
**User Requirements:**
1. In this week‚Äôs HOS, you have learned how to create Stack Navigator and add Screens to the ‚ÄúCitiesNav‚Äù tab. You are expected to enhance PE05 by adding stack-based navigators to the ‚ÄúCountriesNav‚Äù tab.
2. In the ‚ÄúCountriesNav‚Äù tab, you will show the countries list and their currencies used or not used in the country. 
3. Like Cities and City, you will show a stack-based navigation between Countries and Country.
4. All styles are customized for Countries, Country, and Currency.

Addtional Note: 
1. You can refer¬†to Chapter 6 Navigation¬†from the textbook ‚ÄúReact Native in Action,‚Äù to understand tab and stack-based navigation.
2. The textbook must be used for reference only. Some APIs are outdated and might have nonfunctional code. 
3. Use your HOS08 and PE05 to finish this exercise successfully.

Personal Note:
I DO NOT have a full understanding of the CountriesNav's functionality. I completed the task to my best knowledge of the assignment's requirement based on the context and the shared screenshots. 

**System Requirements:**
- Bottom Tab Navigator
- React Native Screens
- React Native uuid
- You must use the core components at least once ‚Äì View, Text, ScrollView, Image, TextInput, StyleSheet, TouchableHighlight, FlatList, Platform, NavigationContainer, createBottomTabNavigator, createNativeStackNavigator, LogBox, etc. 

## input-process-output model:
1. A requirement from the environment (input)
2. A computation based on the requirement (process)
3. A provision for the environment (output)

### 1. Input
Runs the app in the development mode after creating a Mobile app

Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in your browser.

### 2. Process
1. Create a Github repo
2. Select the _"code"_ button from the tab and from the dropdown menu select Codespaces to create codespace on main.

3. In the terminal run to create the mobile app:
```
npx create-expo-app YourMobileAppName
```
4. CD into the newly created YourMobileAppName directory from the terminal.
5. Install the following:
```
npm install @react-navigation/native
```
```
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-contex
```
```
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

**"main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js",**

7. Connect your Expo credentials run (optional):
```
npx expo login
```
Note: enter your username and password

#### Optional
To reset project script to start from scratch run:

```
npm run reset-project
```

8. Add your code. Once satisfied. To start up your app, run:
```
npm run web
```
OR
```
npx expo start --tunnel
```

Note: Uses a **_tunnel_** connection (via Expo servers), allowing your mobile device to connect even if it‚Äôs on a different Wi-Fi or cellular network.

If it asks to install @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0, type **_"y"_** for yes.

9. Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in your browser, scan the QR code or manually type the exp://vxwrh30-anonymous-8081.exp.direct/ url onto your mobile device.

# Additional Information


# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
